package Queues;

// Queue<Integer> que=new ArrayDeque<>();
// Queue is an interface which is implemented by Dequeue interface which is implemented by ArrayDeque class
// Queue and Deque are just the intefaces and they only have the declarations of the functions in them
// When a class implements these intefaces, then the class fills the body of those functions
// thats why we make an object of ArrayDeque in Queue

// functions in queue are-:
// 1. que.add(value);       pushes a value in the end of queue
// 2. que.remove();         removes a value from the front of queue, it also returns the front value
// 3. que.peek();           shows the front value from the queue
